Determining the rules the postoffice uses.

Surface area and Volume: Post office uses Rectangular Prism formula rounding each value up to the next multiple of three.

Cost is Volume x Mass but the mass is capped at nearest multiple of 3 rounded down?

Determing the surface area.


Test 1:
        Length: 1
        Width: 1
        Height: 1

        Length: 2
        Width: 2
        Height: 2
Result:
        Surface Area: 54
Test 3:
        Length: 4
        Width: 4
        Height: 4

        Surface Area: 216
Test 4:
        Length: 3
        Width: 3
        Height: 4
Result:
        Surface Area: 90

Surface Area has a minimum value of 54. Incorrect.
Has multiple fixed box sizes up to a certain size?

Test:
        Length: 0
        Width: 1
        Height: 1
Result:
        Surface Area: 18.

Surface area does not have a minimum value.


Test:
        Length: 12
        Width: 6
        Height: 6
Result:
        Surface Area: 360

Occasionally follows the formula of Rectangular Prism Formula but not consistently.

Test:
        Length: 12
        Width: 5
        Height: 6
Result:
        Surface Area: 360

Fixed sizes while using Rectangular Prism Formula?

Test:
        Length: 3
        Width: 3
        Height: 3
Result:
        Surface Area: 54

Test:
        Length: 3
        Width: 3 
        Height: 4

Test:
        Length: 6
        Width : 6
        Height: 6
Result:
        Surface Area: 360

Fixed sizes with size incrementing by 3x3x3. E.g. 3x3x3, 6x6x6, 9x9x9.

Test:
        Length: 4
        Width : 3
        Height: 5
Result:
        Surface Area : 144

No fixed size increase by 3x3x3's.

Test:
        Length: 8
        Width : 8
        Height: 8
Result:
        Surface Area : 486.

486 is the Surface Area of 9x9x9.
Increases by 3x3x3 if the dimensions are equal.

Switching to Volume to get another perspective.

Test:
        Length: 3 
        Width: 3
        Height: 3
Result:
        Volume : 27
Test:
        Length: 3 
        Width: 3
        Height: 4
Result:
        Volume : 54
Test:
        Length: 6
        Width: 3
        Height: 3
Result:
        Volume : 54
Doesn't increase by 3x3x3's. Each individual value increments by 3.
Test:
        Length: 8
        Width: 4
        Height: 4
Result:
        Volume : 324
Test:
        Length: 8
        Width: 6
        Height: 6
Result:
        Volume : 324

324 is the Surface Area of a Rectangular prism with the values 8x6x6.

Post office uses Rectangular Prism formula rounding each value up to the next multiple of three for volume.

Working out Cost.

Test:
        Surface Area: 54
        Mass : 2
Result: 
        Cost : 36
Test:
        Surface Area: 54
        Mass : 3
Result: 
        Cost : 54

Incrementing by 18?

Test:
        Surface Area: 54
        Mass : 4
Result: 
        Cost : 81
Test:
        Dimensions : 3x3x3
        Surface Area: 54
        Mass : 6
Result: 
        Cost : 81
Capped at 81. 81/27 is 3?

Test:
        Dimensions : 5x5x5
        Surface Area: 216
        Mass : 100
Result: 
        Cost : 216

Test:
        Dimensions : 5x5x5
        Surface Area: 216
        Mass : 1000
Result: 
        Cost : 216
Cost is VolumexMass but the mass is capped at nearest multiple of 3 rounded down?
